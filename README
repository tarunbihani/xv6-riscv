xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern RISC-V multiprocessor using ANSI C.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

xv6 is inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer
to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14,
2000)).  See also https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.1810/, which provides
pointers to on-line resources for v6.

ERROR REPORTS

Please send errors and suggestions to Frans Kaashoek and Robert Morris
(kaashoek,rtm@mit.edu).  The main purpose of xv6 is as a teaching
operating system for MIT's 6.1810, so we are more interested in
simplifications and clarifications than new features.

BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6

You will need a RISC-V "newlib" tool chain from
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain, and qemu compiled for
riscv64-softmmu.  Once they are installed, and in your shell
search path, you can run "make qemu".


Done
-> compile, run & debug kernal code.
-> compile instructions
    https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2022/tools.html 
-> run 
    make qemu
    exit xv6 os : CTRL + a,x

-> debug run kernal
    Terminal 1 : make qemu-gdb  
        this command will start waiting on a command and ask to attache yourself to a gdb session
    Terminal 2 : gdb-multiarch kernel/kernel {this will be a remote debug session}
    1. continue : will continue the os forward
    2. add a break point into one of the system calls to check if call enters there (exec is good option)
    3. run some user command (ls,cat...) in Terminal 1 
        break point will hit 
    4 use tui enable or l to see the code

-> Debug Init of kernal
    Above Steps can be used to debug kernal initialization code {kernel/main.c} with one small change
    After attaching the gdb session add a breakpoint in main.c
        b main
    and then continue

    
-> debug user command code.
	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10534798/debugging-user-code-on-xv6-with-gdb
	NOTE there might be issues with multiprocesses.


To Do

-> get a know how on how the flow is from user to kernal via system calls
-> implement sleep user command.
